# InboxInsights
I will prepare a solution that reads my e-mail content and interprets what is written in it with LLM and Agentic AI. This solution will understand whether an e-mail with a content belonging to a subject I expect at that time and inform me. For example, if I am applying for a job, it will mark whether there is a positive or negative return among the returns I receive. If there is a positive one, it informs me in order not to skip the intensity in other incoming e-mails.
